The considered environments have a natural reference system with three orthogonal axes, and contain sets of lines parallel to these axes. The estimated orientation is a three-dimensional rotation between the natural reference frame and the camera frame. <em>Corisco</em> requires the knowledge of the camera model, but any camera model can be used. <em>Corisco</em> analyzes images using a process that extracts edgels, which are points located on the projections of the environment lines, associated with the tangential direction of the line projection at that point. This edgel extraction technique uses a grid mask that can sub-sample the data, creating a compromise between speed and precision. The orientation is estimated through a two-step optimization process that minimizes an objective function defined by the M-estimation technique, using a redescending error function. This technique is equivalent to the application of the MAP or the EM estimation in similar existing methods. The first optimization step uses the RANSAC algorithm, allowing <em>Corisco</em> to work without initial estimates, and the second step is a continuous and constrained optimization process that explores the orientation parametrization by quaternions. <em>Corisco</em> was tested with different camera models, including the perspective projection, a model with radial distortion, and two omnidirectional projections, the polar equidistant and the equirectangular. The mean calculation time can be controlled through a couple of parameters, which may also affect the accuracy. The accuracy observed by comparing the <em>Corisco</em> estimates with reference orientations was typically near 1 degree for execution times above 20 seconds, and approximately 4 degrees for less than two seconds. This performance attained the established objectives, and the experimental results validated the method for practical applications.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Artificial intelligence.
